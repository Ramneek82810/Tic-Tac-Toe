## How It Works 🛠️
At the heart of this project is the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making approach used in perfect-information games like Tic Tac Toe. To improve performance, Alpha-Beta Pruning optimizes the Minimax process by reducing unnecessary computations.

### Key Concepts 📚:
1. **Minimax Algorithm 🔍**: Simulates all possible moves and their outcomes to select the best possible decision.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning ⚡**: Reduces the number of branches evaluated in the decision tree, improving the AI's speed and efficiency.
3. **Perfect Play 🎯**: By combining these techniques, the AI ensures it never loses, challenging players to bring their A-game.

## Technologies Used 🖥️
- **Python 🐍**: Core programming language.
- **Algorithms 🧮**: Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- **Tkinter 🎨** (Optional): For creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

## How to Play 🎲
- The game board is a standard **3x3 grid**. ➕
- Players alternate turns to place their marks (**X** or **O**). ✏️
- The objective is to get **three marks in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). 🏅
- If no player achieves this and the board is full, the game ends in a **draw**. 🤝

**Game Flow 🔄**:
1. Start the game. ▶️
2. Choose who moves first (you or the AI). ⚔️
3. Play your moves while observing the AI's optimal responses. 🤖
4. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full. 🏁

## Future Improvements 🔮
- **Custom Board Sizes 📐**: Allow 4x4, 5x5, or larger grids for more challenging gameplay.
- **Difficulty Levels 🎚️**: Implement adjustable AI difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Graphical Interface 🎨**: Enhance user experience with a polished GUI using Tkinter or Pygame.
- **Two-Player Mode 👥**: Add an option to play against a human opponent.
- **AI Training 🧠**: Explore reinforcement learning to train an AI for adaptive play.
